# This is my first Progressive Web App testing

If you want to test this in you local 

    #clone this repository and put it in your apache html folder..  
    # note * if you are using php -S command or any other i am not sure that all the relative paths to assets will work or not
    
    
if you want to test it in your mobile then add to add to home screen .. 
you need a server with real https server.


This app supports offline mode also.


It returns all the assets and responses form network first if no network then takes from cache.. 
 while taking from network it caches every response so if you go offline you will see last response.

*note this was my strategy to show the responses.

we can do whatever we want
